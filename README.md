# Library Management System

This project is a simple Java-based Library Management System.  
It defines classes for **Book**, **User**, and **Library**, allowing you to manage books and users through a command-line interface.  

The system supports adding new books and users, issuing and returning books, and displaying all records.  
It demonstrates object-oriented programming concepts such as **encapsulation**, **composition**, and **method interaction** between classes.
